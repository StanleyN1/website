<!-- As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.

The figure element above has an inline style of `width: 1200px` set which should break it outside of the normal content flow.

<figure style="width: 225px" class="align-right">
  <img src="/assets/images/Portugal.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center"> Portugal, 2020.</figcaption>
</figure>

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And that's a wrap, yo! You survived the tumultuous waters of alignment. Image alignment achievement unlocked! -->

When I am not working, I enjoy being active â€” lifting weights at the gym while listening to punk music, riding my bike, or going for a hike in one of the nearby National Parks.

I have been vegan for more than 12 years, so I'm always curious to try out new recipes or to find the best vegan restaurants in the area.

I love traveling and exploring new cultures, but for now I'm happy to go on weekend trips along the California coast and I just recently discovered surfing is a great catalyst for both physical and mental health.
