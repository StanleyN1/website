# About

I am a graduate research assistant and PhD candidate at the [Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/).
My research is supervised by [Professor Leszek Demkowicz](http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~leszek/). <br>
<!-- 
I was a [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics fellow](http://www.whoi.edu/gfd/) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in 2017.
Previously, I obtained a M.Sc. in computational methods in aeronautical engineering from Imperial College London, and bachelor's degrees in both mathematics and mechanical engineering from the Universidad de los Andes (Colombia). -->

My research is driven towards understanding — e.g. characterizing, quantifying, and, ultimately, predicting — natural phenomena through mathematical modelling.
From this purview, computer methods are indispensable in order to make decisions and reach conclusions for contemporary problems in science and engineering.
By employing mathematical tools from functional analysis, topology, differential geometry, and numerical linear algebra, the intent of my research is to develop the most accurate and practical algorithms for modern scientific and engineering purposes.

<!-- Generally speaking, my research deals with the accurate and efficient numerical approximation of solutions to differential equations, especially those which arise in the modelling of complex physical systems.
Therefore, my research often deals with: (a) developing physical models for a given problem at hand; (b) discretizing the chosen model so that it 
I am interested in designing algorithms for these purposes which account for extrinsic outputs of the  -->

<!-- When I'm not doing research I'm probably either playing or watching "fútbol".
My clock definitely stops ticking every four years for the World Cup.
In my free time I also love to watch movies and TV series (advanced user: several thousand hours under my belt), browse youtube, read the news, enjoy books, and watch other sporting events like tennis (all hail Roger Federer) and baseball (go Cards!). -->
