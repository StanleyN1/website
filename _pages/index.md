# About

I am a graduate research assistant and PhD candidate at the [Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/).
My research is supervised by [Professor Leszek Demkowicz](http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~leszek/).
I will graduate by May 2018 and so I am looking for postdoctoral positions. <br>
<!-- 
I was a [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics fellow](http://www.whoi.edu/gfd/) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in 2017.
Previously, I obtained a M.Sc. in computational methods in aeronautical engineering from Imperial College London, and bachelor's degrees in both mathematics and mechanical engineering from the Universidad de los Andes (Colombia). -->


My research deals with the accurate and efficient numerical approximation of solutions to differential equations, especially those which arise in the modelling of complex physical systems.
<!-- Therefore, my research often deals with: (a) developing physical models for a given problem at hand; (b) discretizing the chosen model so that it  -->
I am interested in designing algorithms for these purposes which account for extrinsic outputs of the 

<!-- My research lies in the interdisciplinary intersection of mathematics, physics, engineering and computational science.
More specifically, I do research in computational mathematics that involves numerical analysis and nonlinear dynamics.
Within numerical analysis, I am interested in finite element methods and applied functional analysis.
In the last few years, I have helped develop some of the latest advances in discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods, which are very effective at solving partial differential equations (PDEs), and have many physical applications.
Within nonlinear dynamics, I like to study hydrodynamic stability of classical flows, like plane Couette flow.
Here, (fluid) dynamical systems are posed in the form of a semidefinite program (SDP) with sum-of-squares (SoS) constraints, and then a computer is used to derive some important stability properties of the dynamical system. -->

<!-- When I'm not doing research I'm probably either playing or watching "fÃºtbol".
My clock definitely stops ticking every four years for the World Cup.
In my free time I also love to watch movies and TV series (advanced user: several thousand hours under my belt), browse youtube, read the news, enjoy books, and watch other sporting events like tennis (all hail Roger Federer) and baseball (go Cards!). -->
