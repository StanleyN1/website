<!-- # About -->

<p style="text-align: justify">
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics at Brown University.
Previously, I was a postdoc <!-- in the <a href="https://www-m2.ma.tum.de/">Chair for Numerical Mathematics</a>  -->at the Technical University of Munich, supervised by <a href="http://www.professoren.tum.de/en/wohlmuth-barbara/">Barbara Wohlmuth</a>.
I was incredibly fortunate to attend the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/">Oden Institute</a>, where I earned my Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~leszek/">Leszek Demkowicz</a>.

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify">
My research is driven towards characterizing, quantifying, and, ultimately, predicting natural phenomena by way of mathematical modelling.
Within this purview, numerical methods are indispensable.
Indeed, they <em>must</em> be used in order to make informed decisions and reach reliable conclusions when facing contemporary problems in science and engineering.
By employing mathematical tools from functional analysis, topology, differential geometry, and numerical linear algebra, the intent of my research is to develop the most accurate and practical numerical methods for modern scientific and engineering purposes.

<p style="text-align: justify">
My work typically focuses on numerical methods for PDEs, but I try to work on some other fun topics from time to time.
